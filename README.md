# OBSOLETE

This extension is compatible only with Firefox 3.0.x, a branch which reached end-of-life on 24 April 2012. It could probably be made to work on some newer versions, but certainly not any that are still supported. I might update it for Pale Moon or Waterfox someday but I wouldn't hold your breath.

## Winestripe

Winestripe is a repackaging of the Winestripe default theme from Firefox 2 in a Firefox 3 extension.

### Installation

Download and install the xpi from the [releases page](https://github.com/TortoiseWrath/winestripe/releases).

### License

The Winestripe theme assets and code (by Mozilla and Firefox contributors) and all original code in this extension are available under the Mozilla Public License 1.1.
